Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.

In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.

1. Experiment Design
1.1 Unit of Diversion (provided by Udacity)

The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.
1.2 Initial Hypothesis

The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course. (Provided by Udacity)

Based on the information above, we can set some initial hypotheis: (these are just initial hypothesis and we will revise them further)

    H0: the change has no effect on the number of students who enroll the free trial.
    H1: the change reduces the number of students who enroll the free trial.

    H0: the change has no effect on the number of students who leave the free trial.
    H1: the change reduces the number of students who leave the free trial.

    H0: the change has no effect on the probability of students who continue the free trial after 14 days.
    H1: the change increases the probability of students who continue the free trial after 14 days.
    (since we cannot say the number will be increased or decreased here, we use probability.)

1.3 Metric Choice

there are seven choices from Udacity below.

    Number of cookies: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=3000)
    Number of user-ids: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. (dmin=50)
    Number of clicks: That is, number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). (dmin=240)
    Click-through-probability: That is, number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=0.01)
    Gross conversion: That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button. (dmin= 0.01)
    Retention: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. (dmin=0.01)
    Net conversion: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button. (dmin= 0.0075)

dmin means the practical significance boundary for each metric, that is, the difference that would have to be observed before that was a meaningful change for the business, is given in parentheses. All practical significance boundaries are given as absolute changes.
1.3.1 Choosing Invariant Metrics

The invariant metrics (control variables) are metrics that we expect not to change between experiment and control group. And they will be used for sanity check

Based on the metrics above, we would like to treat these three as invariant metrics:

    Number of cookies
    Number of clicks
    Click-through-probability: Number of clicks / Number of cookies

Because these are the data that we can collect before the change, so they must nearly be same in both test and control group. And these three are all dependent on cookies, which is the unit of diversion for this project.
Also, for the click through probability, though it covers both number of cookies and number of clicks, it might be unexpected vary during sanity check, so it is much safer to track those three.
1.3.2 Choosing Evaluation Metrics

For evaluation indicators, we should not only care the statistical significance, but also whether the change of the metric is significant in practice (dmin), because the treatment may not be worth implementing (although there is statistical significance).

We consider these three metrics below can be used for our A/B testing project.

    Gross conversion: we expect this metric will be decreased in treatment group. (users get the question and will have a second to consider enroll or not, this will filter some users who are not willing to checkout after free trial period).

    Retention: we expect this metric will be increased in treatment group. (since the question has already filtered some uses who are not willing to checkout after free trial period, the retention rate should get higher).

    Net conversion: since it is the product of the two above, we cannot expect its direction, which may vary.

    Attention: Number of user-ids: for this metric, we won't use it because:
        User-ids are tracked only after enrolling in the free trial, so we cannot expect the equal distribution between the control and experimental group. It isn't normalized.
        Also, the information about number of user-ids can be inculded in the gross conversion.

1.3.3 Hypothesis Revised

Based on the metrics we choose and the initial hypothesis, we can revise our hypothesis.

    H0: Gross Conversion(control) = Gross Conversion(treatment)
    H1: Gross Conversion(control) != Gross Conversion(treatment)
    H0: Retention(control) = Retention(treatment)
    H1: Retention(control) != Retention(treatment)
    H0: Net Conversion(control) = Net Conversion(treatment)
    H1: Net Conversion(control) != Net Conversion(treatment)

2. Measuring Standard Deviation

In binomial distribution, the standard deviation = sqrt(p(1-p)/n)

Standard Deviation for Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation Metrics 	Standard Deviation
Gross Conversion 	0.0202
Retention 	0.0549
Net Conversion 	0.0156
3. Sizing

We set the alpha to be 0.05 and the statistical power to be 0.80 (i.e. beta is 0.20). And we used an online calculator and the results are as follows.

Sizing for Each Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation Metrics 	Sample Size
Gross Conversion 	645,875
Retention 	4,741,212
Net Conversion 	685,325

Given the calculation above, to test these three hypothesis, we need 4,741,212 pageviews.
3.0.1 multiple hypothesis?

As we now have three hypothesis, and these three hypothesis are not fully independent. So the false positive rate is likely to be increased. We can solve the multiple hypothesis problem by Bonferroni Correction method, but it still has backward that it will increase the fale negatives. Therefore, we prefer not to solving this problem.
3.1 Choosing Duration vs. Exposure

From the Udacity, given there are 40k pageviews per day, we can first assume we can use 100% of users for this experiment. However, we've calculated that:

    for the experiment with gross conversion, retention and net conversion, we need: 119 days
    for the experiment with gross conversion and net conversion, we need: 17 days

We can see there is a huge difference in experiment duration between using and discarding retention. Therefore, we decide to remove the retention metric for this experiment. Because firstly, using the retention metric will take a long time to conduct this experiment, which will cause opportunity costs(eg. launch more different experiments, spend more time on other feature improvements). Moreover, there will be some business risks that exist if we use the retention metric. For instance, this change will give a worse user experiment decreasing the conversion rate.

Also, for the experiment with gross conversion and net conversion, we should reconsider the fraction of Udacity's traffic to be diverted. Considering there might be some seasonal effect for this experiment, 17 days seems not enough for us to certain. Secondly, using full traffic is very costly and risky (opportunity cost & business risk we mentioned above). Diverting a half or lower of traffic will be much safer.

    for the experiment using 50% traffic with gross conversion and net conversion, we need: 34 days
    for the experiment using 45% traffic with gross conversion and net conversion, we need: 38 days

It seems that 38 days are little bit longer, so we will divert 50% traffic for the experiment with gross conversion and net conversion.
4. Experiment Analysis

Now, we have two datasets from Udacity, one for control group and one for experiment group.

The meaning of each column is:

    Pageviews: Number of unique cookies to view the course overview page that day.
    Clicks: Number of unique cookies to click the course overview page that day.
    Enrollments: Number of user-ids to enroll in the free trial that day.
    Payments: Number of user-ids who who enrolled on that day to remain enrolled for 14 days and thus make a payment. (Note that the date for this column is the start date, that is, the date of enrollment, rather than the date of the payment. The payment happened 14 days later. Because of this, the enrollments and payments are tracked for 14 fewer days than the other columns.)

4.1 Sanity Check
4.1.1 visualization

We can make some visualizations to make a clear comparison between control and experiment groups on invariant metrics.

Here we also found there is a dramatically drop on click through rate on Oct. 24th. It's worthwhile to find the potential reason and effects.
4.1.2 sanity checks

First, we've already calculated the size of control group and experiment group:

control group size: 345543 experiment size: 344660 sample size: 690203 Is the difference between the size of control group and experiment group within our expectations?

cookies and clicks Given each cookie is randomly assgined to the control or experiment group with probability 0.5. If we now regard being assigned to the control group as a success, we can use the binominal distribution to model the number of successes in the given whole sample (control+experiment) and perform a binomial test as sanity check. (We further assume the whole sample size are large enough to approach the normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem)). (And for the Clicks metric, we can also use the binomial test.)

click through probability For the click through probability, we've already assumed the sample performs the normal distribution. Therefore, we can further assume that the click through probability in both control and experiment groups perform the binomial distribution. So we can lauch a Z-test to check the click through probability. (pooled p)
Invariant Metrics 	CI_lower 	CI_upper 	Observed Value 	Result
Cookies 	0.4988 	0.5012 	0.5006 	Pass
Clicks 	0.4959 	0.5042 	0.5005 	Pass
CTP 	0.0812 	0.0830 	0.0822 	Pass

Based on the Sanity Check chart, we can conclude that all invariant metrics have stood the test successfully.
4.2 Result Analysis
4.2.1 visualization

We can make some visualizations to make a clear comparison between control and experiment groups on evaluation metrics.

We can also see there is a huge peak on Oct.24th. According to we've mentioned a drop of click through probability on Oct.24th, we can infer that there is a larger number of pageviews. We recommend Udacity teams to do some further analysis on the whole traffic instead of this sample size.
4.2.2 Check for Practical and Statistical Significance

Now, both gross conversion and net conversion are probabilities, similar to click-through probability. Therefore, we can check them as we checked the click-through rate above. However, this time we will check for both practical(dmin) and statistical significance. Notice: Because the payments and enrollments are None in the last 14 days, we should recalculate the real sample size for checking the evaluation metrics.
Evaluation Metrics 	CI_lower 	CI_upper 	Observed Value 	Statistic Result 	dmin 	Practical Result
Gross Conversion 	-0.0291 	-0.0120 	-0.0205 	Pass 	-0.01 	Pass
Net Conversion 	-0.0116 	0.5042 	0.0019 	Fail 	0.0075 	Fail

Now we can see the gross conversion decreased 2% in this A/B test, which was statiscally and practically significant while the net conversion was not.
4.2.3 Week Analysis

At last, we were asked to finish the sign test for this A/B test. However, the prior assumption for sigh test that the two dependent samples should be paired or matched viloates our A/B test assumption. So we will forgo this additional test, instead, we can make an analysis about the seasonality.
Day 	GC_control 	GC_experiment 	diff_GC 	NC_control 	NC_experiment 	diff_NC
Mon 	0.2234 	0.2032 	-0.0203 	0.1250 	0.1177 	-0.0073
Tue 	0.2075 	0.1825 	-0.0249 	0.1234 	0.1166 	-0.0068
Wed 	0.2158 	0.1987 	-0.0170 	0.1002 	0.1102 	0.0099
Thu 	0.1944 	0.2122 	0.0178 	0.0959 	0.0908 	-0.0050
Fri 	0.2539 	0.2287 	-0.0251 	0.1406 	0.1187 	-0.0219
Sat 	0.2140 	0.1732 	-0.0408 	0.1342 	0.1025 	-0.0316
Sun 	0.2247 	0.1970 	-0.0277 	0.1048 	0.1283 	0.0235

From charts above, we can see this experiment are less effective for gross conversion on Thursday, with regards to the net conversion, Wednesday and Sunday are not effective. We can also see this experiment for net conversion are more fluctuated in a week.
4.3 Results Interpretation & Recommendations

    Gross conversion: the observed gross conversion in the experiment group is around 2.06% less than the gross conversion observed in the control group. Also, we see that values in the confidence interval are congruent with a negative effect. Since these values are less than the dmin (the smallest impact size considered to be business-related), the impact seems to be statiscally and practically significant. What is more, the impact of this test is much larger on Sundays while there is nearly no impact on Thursdays.

    Net conversion: Although we cannot reject the null hypothesis for this test, we see that the observed net conversion in the experiment group is around 0.49% less than the net conversion observed in the control group. Therefore, for this test, the impact is not significant neither in stastics or business issue.

Based on these results, we can assume that this change may indeed help to set clearer expectations for students upfront. However, the results show that only gross conversion is practically and statiscally significant, not both gross and net converison. So we can further assume that this experiment is effective for decreasing the free trial enrollment, but payments cannot be converted. Therefore, my recommend is not to launch, instead, we should do some further experiments.
5. Follow-Up Experiment: How to Reduce Early Cancellations

Given that Udacity want to reduce early cancellation (early cancellation is the cancellation before the end of the 14-day free trial period that triggered the payment), we can consider from two ascpects: before the free trial enrollment and after the enrollment.

    Before the free trial enrollment, our goal is to let users with more purchasing potential enroll meanwhile guide other users to access free course materials, which may attract more potential users in the long term. Therefore, based on the experiment we've done, this time we can improve the form regarding the time commitment. Firstly, this form is only used to filter students who cannot devote enough time, however, it does not contain prerequisites for the course. Some students may spend a fairly long time on this course but they are still frustrated due to lack of prerequisite knowledge. Therefore, we should also notice students the prerequisites for the course on the form. Secondly, we also need to convert non-purchasing potential student to obtain the free course materials. So if some students do not meet the commitment and prerequisites, the form should have a button that allows students to directly convert to access free course materials.
    Therefore, we could launch this experiment again, but add the click through probability for the free course material as variant metric. (free course material click through probability: number of unique cookies to click the "free course material" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page).
    A successful experiment would be a significant decrease in the total conversion and a significant increase in the net conversion rate and the free course materials click through probability.

    For the users who have already enrolled, it is necessary to improve their user experience and make them more satisfied, so that they are willing to stay. Due to the limited coaching resources, I think the interaction between students can be increased. An effective method might be to have students led by a tutor form a group. Students can learn from and help each other, and it may also have a potential sense of competition. In this way, the group can make students more motivated and have a sense of belonging, which may lead to retention.

        The experiment design: For the students who have enrolled, randomly assgin them to experiment group and control group. In the experiment group, students will be assigned to the groups according to their mentors. And in the control group, students will not be assigned.

        Unit of Diversion: the unit of diversion will be user-ids, because this experiment will occur after students enrolling the free trial where they should create accounts or sign in.

        Hypothesis: Null Hypotheis: Setting groups will not increase significantly the number of students who will continue their course after 14 days free trial. Alternative Hypothesis: Setting groups will increase significantly the number of students who will continue their course after 14 days free trial.

        Invariant Metrics: the invariant metric should be the number of user-ids as it is the data that we can collect before the change and it is dependent on the unit of diversion for this experiment.

        Evaluation Metrics: the evaluation metric will be rentention. Retention is the number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout.

    If a statistically and practically significant positive change in retention is observed, given the sanity check is passed, assuming the resources and cost is acceptable for Udacity, then we can launch this experiment.
